## Planning
As a group we decided that we would deploy both the Front End & Back End sites
the weekend prior to the group project start (this proved to be fortuitous as
GitHub had issues on the first day). Scott took care of the initial deployment
and we discussed, as a group, how we would proceed throughout the project period
over the weekend and Monday. We made a decision that we would organize the three
day period as such:

Tue = Back-End API
Wed = Back-End API (Morning), Front-End (Afternoon)
Thu = Front-End & Styling

We came up with the initial wireframe and ERD (see links below), along with a
workflow for our Git, a SCRUM schedule, User Stories, Culture Code, and
questions for our initial meeting with the faculty (those items have been listed
below as well):

#### Git Workflow
Naming convention for feature branches will be based off issue number (i.e.
"api-issue-2" or "client-issue-5") - the workflow will be some variation of the
following:

- Create a feature branch off the development branch.
- When feature completed:
- “git add” the files
- “git commit” the files - first line = title, second line = hyphen, third line
(and after) = body of commit, last line = “close #x”
- “git push” the feature to the development branch
- Notify the group that a feature has been completed and tested so the group can
review the code together
- Meet and review the code, if remaining team members approve the code, Project
Lead confirms the pull in the development branch and merges the changes on
GitHub
- Everyone rebases to the new development branch

#### Scrum Schedule
Morning meeting at 9:15am and afternoon close-out at 4:30pm. Any work done after
hours will be decided at that point.

#### Culture Code
- Respect is mutually given, not earned
- Be an open communicator: do not disengage when working in a group, and
practice active listening.
- Be open to constructive feedback: when giving feedback, be specific.
- Take others’ intent into account
- Be collaborative, share freely, and respect others’ abilities and preferences.
- Maintain a growth mindset and a good attitude.
- Ask lots of questions, but do your due diligence!
- Leave outside stress and your ego at the door.
- Foster a space where it is safe to fail and learn from mistakes.
- Have fun!

For the first day we stuck to the schedule, practicing "Mob Programming" on the
back-end (more about that in the other README). Limited work was done on the
front-end with the exception of light folder creation and HTML form creation.
